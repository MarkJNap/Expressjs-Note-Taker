# Express Note Taker

## Description

Creating the backend for this Note Taker application was my first project dealing with Express,js, Heroku and connecting to a database file. I was very happy with how I went with this project and it went smoothly. I was also glad to ultilize the DELETE route and add in id generation with uuidv4. Dealing with an existing front end and creating a new backend will be extremely useful in my future.

## Installation

If running from Heroku visiting the link is all, no further installation steps are required.

If you would like to clone and install on a local machine you will need to have:
* Node.js v16
* GitBash or equivalent

You will also need to install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the correct folder.

This app has `express` and `uuid` dependencies.


## Usage

If you are using this after cloning and installing you can begin by typing `npm start` and navigate to http://localhost:3001/ where it will be running.

Otherwise you can simply go to the Heroku hosted webpage.

You will be greeted by a landing page with a `Get Started` button.
After clicking on the button you will be redirected to the notes page.
Where it is possible for you to add, save, view and delete notes.
By clicking the save icon after writing your note it will be saved and added to the left column of the page.
And if you click that note it will display on the right and can even be deleted by clicking on the red delete icon.

The Heroku link is: LINK GOES HERE
